            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In our project, we have developed two systems to comprehensively
              control tomato gray mold disease caused by
              <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Our plant immune system is used to
              activate the broad-spectrum immunity of tomatoes to prevent tomato
              gray mold disease, while our RNAi system is used to kill the
              <i>B. cinerea</i> or reduce its infectivity. To combine the two
              systems, we use the polycobead system to encapsulate the plant
              immune system and the RNAi system, making the biopesticide more
              storage-friendly and convenient to use.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              In our Project, we followed the DBTL principle, tested the
              functions of RNAi and PolycoBead during the project cycle, and
              improved and iterated according to the test results, so that they
              finally achieved our expected results.

                <p>
                  Due to its high specificity, safety, and sustainability, we
                  have chosen RNAi technology for the treatment of tomato gray
                  mold disease. After screening, we selected <i>BcchsIIIa</i>,
                  <i>Bccyp51</i>, <i>BcOAH1</i>, and <i>Bcpme1</i> as our
                  targets for RNAi. Since shRNA is known to have higher
                  stability in natural environments and can be produced on a
                  large scale at low cost using fermentation engineering in the
                  laboratory, we have selected the most common strain,
                  <i>E. coli</i>, for fermentation production. We used
                  <i>E. coli</i>
                  HT115(DE3), which lacks nucleases. The designed target
                  sequences are constructed through the order of sense fragment
                  loop-antisense fragment, and connected to the plasmid
                  pET-28a(+) to obtain our shRNA.

                  To verify our successful transformation, we used specific
                  primers to amplify the plasmids extracted from
                  <i>E. coli</i> by PCR, and demonstrated that our shRNA
                  expression vector successfully entered
                  <i>E. coli</i> HT115(DE3) by agarose gel electrophoresis
                  (Figure1). Subsequently, RNA was extracted from
                  <i>E. coli</i> after IPTG induction, and the successful
                  production of shRNA in <i>E. coli</i> was confirmed by the
                  size of the bands.

                  In our experiments, we used shRNA(gfp) as the control
                  group.The produced shRNA was sprayed on the tomato fruits
                  infected with <i>B. cinerea</i>, and we explored the
                  inhibitory effect of shRNA on gray mold infection in tomatoes
                  by measuring the distribution of disease spots (Figure 2a). We
                  also detected the inhibitory effect of shRNA on target genes
                  using qRT-PCR (Figure 2b). The results indicate that on the
                  third day, the highest silencing rate of the target gene
                  achieved by spraying shRNA(Pme1)-2 was 59%.

                  We found that the inhibitory effect of shRNA on gray mold
                  disease was not as good as we had expected in actual use,
                  which may be because shRNA is still not very stable in natural
                  environments and the probability of cell uptake and processing
                  of shRNA is not high. Faced with this problem, we must find a
                  more effective system to deliver our shRNA.

                  Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been shown to penetrate
                  the plasma membrane of various plant species and tissues.
                  Multiple studies have demonstrated that CPPs can enhance the
                  stability of shRNA and significantly improve the efficiency of
                  silencing through CPP-mediated sRNA delivery systems.
                  Ultimately, we have chosen BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> as our CPP
                  and allowed it to bind to shRNA, hoping that it will confer
                  greater stability to our shRNA under natural conditions and
                  enhance the efficiency of gene silencing on the target gene.

                  To obtain the BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+shRNA complex, we
                  incubated CPP and shRNA in a fixed ratio at room temperature.
                  For the binding of BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> with shRNA, we
                  observed naked shRNA (Figure 3a), naked BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>
                  (Figure 3b), and BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+shRNA complex (Figure
                  3c)under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and significant
                  morphological differences were observed among the three. The
                  presence of spherical aggregates in Figure 3c suggests the
                  successful binding of BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> with shRNA.

                  We sprayed shRNA complexed with BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> onto
                  tomato fruits infected with <i>B. cinerea</i> and explored the
                  inhibitory effect of BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+shRNA on gray mold
                  disease by measuring the distribution of disease spots (Figure
                  4a). We also detected the inhibitory effect of
                  BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+shRNA on the target gene using qRT-PCR
                  (Figure 4b). From the results, it can be observed that
                  BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+shRNA significantly enhanced the
                  efficiency of shRNA-mediated gene silencing on the target
                  gene. Among them, BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> showed the highest

                  <i>Bccyp51</i>
                  increased from 51% to 66%.

                  Although it has been demonstrated that
                  BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+shRNA-mediated gene silencing of
                  individual target genes has shown promising efficacy in the
                  treatment of tomato gray mold disease, we are still not
                  entirely satisfied with the inhibitory effect of a single
                  shRNA on the infection of
                  <i>B. cinerea</i>, especially the unsatisfactory silencing
                  effect on the <i>BcchsIIIa</i> gene. We believe that this
                  situation may be attributed to instability of a single shRNA,
                  among other factors, ultimately limiting the optimal
                  effectiveness of single-target gene silencing by shRNA.

                  a large amount of single shRNA is required, which also reminds
                  us to always consider the cost issue of shRNA.

                <p>
                  We have learned that the bi-shRNA design leads to more rapid
                  onset of gene silencing, higher efficacy, and greater
                  durability when compared with either siRNA or conventional
                  shRNA. By concatenating shRNA molecules targeting different
                  mRNA sequences, the resulting shRNAs can be processed into
                  different siRNAs that act simultaneously. Moreover, compared
                  to mixing and spraying different shRNAs, by concatenating
                  different shRNAs to obtain bi-shRNA, we can save more on the
                  usage of shRNAs while achieving better silencing effects. As
                  shown in the Figure 6, we used website prediction again to
                  optimize shRNAs targeting <i>BcchsIIIa</i> and <i>Bccyp51</i>,
                  resulting in shRNA(CHSIIIa)* and shRNA(cyp51)*, respectively.
                  We then concatenated them to construct bi-shRNA named
                  Box-survival, which collectively silences two important genes
                  essential for the survival of <i>B. cinerea</i>. During
                  application, we will also combine it with cell-penetrating
                  peptide BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> to construct
                  BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub>+bi-shRNA for optimal inhibitory
                  effects.

                  To validate the successful production of Box-survival in
                  <i>E. coli</i>, we constructed a plasmid and transformed it
                  into <i>E. coli</i> for large-scale cultivation. After
                  induction with IPTG, we extracted RNA from <i>E. coli</i> and
                  confirmed the successful generation of shRNA based on the band
                  size observed on the gel. In the gel image, there is a bright
                  band between lanes 100 and 150, which corresponds to the size
                  of 124bp. This is because Box-survival is a concatenation of
                  two shRNAs, resulting in a larger size compared to the
                  designed single-target shRNA (69bp), showing a significant
                  molecular weight difference.

                  Similarly, we sprayed BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> + bi-shRNA on
                  tomato fruits infected with <i>B. cinerea</i> and compared the
                  inhibitory effects of BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> + bi-shRNA with
                  our selected four single-target BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> +
                  bi-shRNA by measuring the distribution of disease spots
                  (Figure 8a). We also examined the inhibitory effect of
                  BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> + bi-shRNA on the target genes of
                  <i>B. cinerea</i> using qRT-PCR, comparing it with
                  BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> + shRNA (Figure 8b). From the results,
                  it can be observed that the optimized sequences of
                  shRNA(CHSIIIa)* and shRNA(cyp51)* exhibit lower off-target
                  probabilities compared to the original sequences. Furthermore,

                  + bi-shRNA demonstrate a stronger inhibitory effect on gray
                  mold disease. From the Figure 8b, we can see that among all
                  shRNAs, bi-shRNA(Box-survival) showed the highest silencing
                  efficiency against the target gene, reaching 70%.

                <p>
                  In order to address the instability of RNAi biopesticides and
                  regulate the amount of pesticide used, we hope to package our
                  product in a specific form to avoid misuse. We drew
                  inspiration from the design of laundry pods and learned that
                  they are made up of individual beads wrapped in PVA film.
                  Through investigation, we found that PVA film has good water
                  solubility, biocompatibility, degradability, high mechanical
                  strength, ease of processing, low production cost, and easy
                  availability. It also has barrier and anti-static properties,
                  which can effectively prevent RNA from coming into contact
                  with nucleases in the environment and being degraded.
                  Therefore, we decided to use PVA film to wrap our CPP-shRNA
                  formulations and the engineered bacterial host
                  <i>B. subtilis</i>.

                <p>
                  As the produced CPP-shRNA complexes exist in the form of an
                  aqueous solution, we need to overcome the water solubility of
                  PVA. To achieve this, we plan to use a powder formulation with
                  strong water-absorbing capability, which does not affect the
                  stability of the CPP-RNA complex, to encapsulate CPP-shRNAs
                  within the beads. Our initial consideration is agarose, a
                  commonly used inert material for nucleic acid electrophoresis
                  in laboratories. Agarose is able to absorb water without
                  introducing large charged groups, thus maintaining the
                  stability of nucleic acids and meeting our basic requirements.
                  Our engineered bacteria are in the form of bacterial powder,
                  and users are required to add sucrose for reconstitution.

                  In our design of Polycobead 1.0, we mix the CPP-shRNA aqueous
                  solution with agarose commonly used in laboratories, and then
                  combine it with the engineered bacterial powder before
                  packaging them in water-soluble PVA film. The resulting pods
                  enhance the stability of the CPP-shRNA complexes and can
                  dissolve rapidly in water for direct application.

                  To understand the structure of our CPP-shRNAs in aqueous
                  solution, we observed the bare shRNAs, bare CPPs and
                  CPP-shRNAs by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From the
                  scanning electron microscope (SEM) results, it can be seen
                  that the naked shRNAs samples showed white spots of different
                  sizes under the scanning electron microscope, which may be
                  caused by the aggregation of shRNAs and the concentration of
                  aggregation is different. And at higher magnification, the
                  white spots will disappear more as the magnification
                  increases, probably because the electron energy of the
                  electron beam is too strong.

                  Finally, our CPP-shRNAs samples were observed by scanning

                  different sizes were observed in the experiment, and smaller
                  clumps of spherical polymers were observed after magnifying

                  It is necessary to improve the release efficiency of
                  bio-pesticides and simplify the use of pesticides. From the
                  design and testing results of our PolycoBead1.0, we identified
                  the following limitations:
                </p>
                <br />

                  <li class="ps-4">
                    1. As a water-absorbing material, agarose cannot be
                    completely dissolved in water at room temperature. The water
                    insolubility of agarose leads to the formation of colloid
                    that can cross-link CPP-shRNAs, resulting in the deposition
                    of agarose at the bottom or the formation of insoluble
                    precipitates after spraying on farmland, resulting in the
                    inability to completely release the active ingredients of
                    pesticides.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li class="ps-4">
                    2. Because we added a suicide switch in the engineered
                    bacteria and the strain needed to be resuscitating, the
                    farmers needed to add additional sucrose to survive and
                    function, which caused a certain amount of inconvenience.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li class="ps-4">
                    3. The price of agarose is expensive. If it is used as an
                    auxiliary material in the coagulation beads, the cost of a
                    single bead will be increased, which makes it difficult to
                    promote in the market.

                  In order to solve the above problems, we decided to iterate on
                  the auxiliary components of coagulation beads to give users a
                  more effective, convenient and affordable experience.

                Due to the disadvantages of agarose in PolycoBead1.0, we wanted
                to find a liquid material that could maintain the stability of
                CPP-shRNA, at the same time be soluble in water, and also would
                not dissolve the PVA film. Glycerol is a polar solvent commonly
                used to preserve biological samples, which can reduce the
                activity of water molecules and protect biomolecules from
                degradation and deformation. Glycerol can be dissolved in any
                proportion with water, which ensures that the beads can release
                the CPP-shRNAs complex at the fastest rate after entering the
                water. In addition, although a small amount of the
                glycerol-water mixture is introduced into the soil, it can also
                be degraded by the microbial community. All of the above
                advantages of glycerol make it the preferred choice for
                providing a liquid environment in coagulation beads.

                In addition, calcium alginate embedding was used to guarantee
                the biological activity of <i>Bacillus subtiliis</i>
                for improving the resuscitation of engineering bacteria in
                PolycoBead1.0. This is one of the most widely used cell fixation
                methods, which has the advantages of high density of fixed
                cells, low toxicity to microorganisms, simple fabrication
                process and high product release rate. By using calcium alginate
                embedding method, engineered bacterial solution and sucrose can
                be encapsulated in a bead at the same time. In the presence of
                sucrose, the toxin-antitoxin mechanism in the engineered
                bacteria is balanced to survive.

                  The engineering bacteria, sucrose and 1% sodium alginate
                  solution were mixed and dropped into Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                  solution. The sodium alginate reacted with calcium ions to
                  form a water-insoluble calcium alginate shell in the outer
                  layer, while the engineering bacteria and sucrose were wrapped
                  in calcium alginate to form smaller beads. These beads were
                  added to glycerol containing CPP-shRNAs, encapsulated in PVA
                  films of certain size, and finally sealed using a heat sealer
                  to obtain our Polycobead 2.0.

                  To ensure that the activity of CPP-shRNA could be maintained
                  in the glycerol system, we used the glycerol system containing
                  CPP-shRNA to verify by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown
                  in the figure, the lanes from left to right are Marker, naked
                  shRNA aqueous solution, naked shRNA glycerol-aqueous solution
                  (glycerol: water = 9:1), CPP-shRNA complex aqueous solution,
                  CPP-shRNA complex glycerol-aqueous solution (glycerol: water =
                  9:1), and Marker repectively. It can be seen from the second
                  and third lanes that glycerol has a certain blocking effect on
                  naked shRNA, but it does not completely affect its movement in
                  electrophoresis. Showing in the fourth and fifth lanes, after
                  combining with CPP, shRNA would form a certain complex
                  structure with CPP and could not move in electrophoresis,
                  while mixing with glycerol did not affect the binding between
                  the two. Meanwhile, we also verified by SEM that the structure
                  of CPP-shRNA in glycerol system does not change.

                  To demonstrate that when the calcium alginate-engineered
                  bacteria complex is released into the environment, the
                  engineered bacteria in the complex will release into the soil
                  at a slow rate along with the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and we
                  have verified that the calcium alginate-engineered bacteria
                  could release the liquid in the soil within 40h. We hope that
                  PolycoBead2.0 can be applied by simply stirring it in water,
                  and the effective constituent will be released to work. The
                  release time of PolycoBead 2.0 was tested and it could be
                  released in 5L water within 2min.

                  Finally, we also tested that the effective constituent in
                  PolycoBead 2.0 could play a good role, so we sprayed the
                  solution with PolycoBead 2.0 on tomatoes infected with
                  <i>B. cinerea</i>, and it could be obviously observed that the
                  solution could play a good inhibitory effect on
                  <i>B. cinerea</i>.

                  It can be concluded from the above results that our PolycoBead
                  can stably encase CPP-shRNA and engineered <i>B. subtilis</i>,
                  then release it stably after dissolving in water, and play a
                  good role in tomato infected with <i>B. cinerea</i>.
                  Therefore, we can prove that PolycoBead 2.0 as our final
                  product can maintain the activity of the effective constituent
                  during storage, show good results in application, and bring
                  more benefits and convenience to farmers when used.
