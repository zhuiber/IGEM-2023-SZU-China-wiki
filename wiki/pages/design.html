            <p>
              Plant fungal disease is one of the main culprits of crop damage,
              it usually first infects a small part of the crop, and then
              quietly infects the surrounding crop without being detected, and
              eventually leads to a large reduction of crop production. In order
              to prevent the onset and transmission of plant fungal diseases,
              people have tried variety of means. Such as crop rotation, spacing
              planting, chemical fungicides, seedling cultivation, the adoption
              of biological control bacteria and so on. However, these measures
              are not effective enough to stop diseases, and its worldwide
              impact can't be ignored. Tomato gray mold is a kind of plant
              fungal disease caused by <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, by taking tomato
              gray mold as a starting point, we hope to find a solution for the
              control of all plant fungal diseases.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In recent years, RNAi biopesticides have attracted much attention.
              By silencing the target genes of pathogenic bacteria by RNAi
              technology, chemical fungicides can be replaced by an effective,
              non-toxic and environmentally friendly way. At the same time,
              during the process of
              <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='human-practices') }}"
                >integrated human practices</a
              >
              , we have paid attention to the concept of "prevention is more
              than cure" and the development of plant immune preparations.
              Therefore, we decided to integrate the two aspects of RNAi
              pesticides and plant immunity into our experimental design.

              During <i>B. cinerea</i> infects tomatoes, it will secrete
              virulence factors to help the attack on tomatoes, and tomatoes
              will secrete immune substances to defend under stress. At this
              point, RNAi pesticides and plant immune agents can play a role in
              the interaction between <i>B. cinerea</i> and the tomato.

              <h3>RNA interference and SIGS</h3>
              <p>
                RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural reaction process, which is
                relatively conserved in evolution. It can silence the expression
                of target genes by specifically targeting the mRNA of cells,
                belonging to post transcriptional regulation of genes (PTGS).
                RNAi usually realizes this regulation process through small RNA
                (sRNA). RNAi is started by microRNA or siRNA, and then formed by
                Dicer or Dicer like (DCL) protein and combined to Ago protein to
                form RNAi silencing complex (RISC), which specifically silences
                the expression of target genes. RNAi has broad application
                prospects in crop disease control due to its specificity,
                efficiency and stability. In addition to autogenesis in
                organisms, there is also cross-border RNAi, that is, sRNAs
                transfer between different species and trigger RNAi process.

              <br />
              <p>
                At present, RNAi is mainly used in crop protection through two
                ways: host induced gene silencing (HIGS) and spray induced gene
                silencing (SIGS). To adopt HIGS means to transform crops through
                transgenic means, however, people's acceptance of Genetically
                Modified products is still not high in China, so this method can
                not be well applied in real life. We soon noticed SIGS, which is
                an emerging, non transgenic RNAi strategy.

                Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) consists of two short reverse
                complementary sequences and a loop sequence to form the hairpin
                structure. shRNA can be actively absorbed by <i>B. cinerea</i>,
                then enter into its cells to be processed into siRNA, and
                further specifically target mRNA to achieve degradation. Or,
                entering plant cells, the related proteins in the cell will
                process and deliver shRNAs to <i>B. cinerea</i>, which can also
                achieve the effect of silencing mRNA, reducing the level of its
                specific protein, and finally forming the inhibition of the
                pathogen. According to the key genes and self-survival genes of
                <i>B. cinerea</i>, we selected 6 targets and designed
                corresponding shRNAs according to these targets.

                  - The cell wall is the main interface for plant and microbial
                  interaction, limiting the invasion of pathogens and the spread
                  of infections. When <i>B. cinerea</i>
                  invades the plant host, it synthesizes exogenous enzymes that
                  degrade pectin, a major component of the plant cell wall.
                  Pectin methylesterase (PME) is a hydrolase that catalyzes the
                  hydrolysis of α ester bonds on pectin molecules in plant cell
                  walls. By silencing

                  acid enters the host plant, the free calcium ions in the host
                  body can form calcium oxalate crystals, which is easy to cause
                  the symptoms of plant blockage and. The release of oxalic acid

                Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) is a short chain amino acid
                composed of about 30 amino acids, including basic amino acids
                and R groups, which can be used to deliver biological molecules
                such as siRNA, pDNA, plasmid and protein, and has been
                relatively mature in the medical field. Engineered CPP and shRNA
                molecules interact via positively charged amino acid residues
                such as arginine and lysine with the phosphate skeleton of
                negatively charged nucleic acids to form submicron
                peptide-nucleic acid complexes. This non-covalent binding method
                has stability and reversibility, thus realizing the transfer and

                domain KH<sub>9</sub> to improve the delivery efficiency of
                biomolecules into plant cells. BP100-(KH)<sub>9</sub> shows a
                spherical shape under the Atomic force microscope (AFM) and can
                wrap shRNA molecules to form spherical complexes. The

                stand at room temperature for a period of time to obtain the
                complex of CPP-shRNA. By spraying CPP-shRNAs on tomatoes
                infected by <i>B. cinerea</i>, shRNAs can enter plant cells more
                efficiently under the effect of CPP. Then, siRNAs are formed
                after processing of Dicer / Dicer-like proteins in cells, which
                will be next delivered to <i>B. cinerea</i>, to achieve the

                In the case of only spraying shRNA molecules against one target

                of target sequence, siRNA sequence and so on. However, after
                concatenating shRNAs targeting different mRNAs using specific
                sequences, the resulting shRNAs molecules can be simultaneously
                processed into different siRNAs to function. The bifunctive
                shRNA (bi-shRNA) was thus used, resulting in a lower effective
                dose than the siRNA/shRNA with the same effect to minimize the
                possibility of non-target side effects and to provide a more

                The above problems are the challenges that need to be addressed
                in the process of fermentation production of RNAi molecules, and
                people usually need to take other measures to eliminate these
                problems, which leads to an increase in the cost of production,
                making RNAi biopesticides difficult to apply. Therefore, we
                designed a cell-free RNAi molecules production system, hoping
                that the successful operation of this system can provide ideas
                for low-cost and high-efficiency application of RNAi molecules.

              <h3>Plant immune pathway</h3>
              <p>
                Plants grow in a complex environment full of harmful pathogenic
                microorganisms, including
                <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. In the process of co-evolution with
                pathogens, plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms to resist
                the infection of pathogens, and gradually formed the plant
                immune system. In response to pathogen attacks, plants have
                developed two typical defense systems: Pathogen-associated
                molecular patterns Triggered Immunity (PTI), and Effector
                Triggered Immunity (ETI).
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In the process of PTI, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
                on the plant cell membrane recognize the pathogen-associated
                molecular patterns (PAMPs) to activate the plant's initial
                defense system, resulting in cell rapid defence responses, such
                as cell necrosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) outbreak, cell
                wall enhancement, regulation of plant hormone pathways, and
                expression of defense-related genes and proteins. PAMPs include
                protein-inducing factors derived from pathogenic bacteria, such
                as harpin protein isolated from <i>Erwinia amylovory</i> and
                <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, glucan-1,4-α-glycosidase
                <i>BcGS1</i> of Botris griseus, and flagellin of
                <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> etc.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                After successful infection, the pathogen interferes with the
                plant's initial PTI response by secreting effector factors, and
                the plant evolves a resistance protein (R protein) that directly
                or indirectly recognizes the specific effectors AVR possessed by
                the pathogen and triggers a more intense and sustained immune
                response, also known as the ETI. Plant immune mechanism has
                signal transduction, including salictlic acid (SA) and ethylene
                (ET) mediated signal transmission pathway, and on this basis the
                whole plant defense network is formed, and finally the whole
                defense response against pathogens is generated.

              <h3>Inducible factors of plant immunity</h3>
              <p>
                According to the characteristics of plant immune process, more
                and more plant immune-inducing factors have been developed and
                used, which have become a new way of plant disease control.
                These include biological and abiotic inducible factors, such as
                the fungus
                <i>Metarhizium</i>, <i>Trichoderma</i>, <i>Paecilomyces</i>,
                etc, the bacteria <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>,
                etc. And some microbial metabolites such as β-1,3-glucan,
                oligo-chitine and other oligosaccharide inducers from fungus,
                and protein inducer such as protein phosphomutase BvEP from
                <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> LJ02. Among them, protein phosphatase
                BvEP from <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> LJ02 has been shown being
                able to induce the PTI and ETI immune pathways in tomato fruits,
                stimulate ROS outbreak and related enzyme expression, and have
                no significant effect on the weight and nutrient content of
                tomato fruits.

              <p>
                <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is one of the most widely accepted
                plant probiotics and has a high homology with
                <i>Bacillus velezensis</i>. It has been reported that
                <i>B. subtilis</i> strains have a control effect on different
                fungal diseases of different plants, such as Rice sheath blight
                in cereal crops, wheat holoses, and tomato gray mold in
                vegetable and fruit crops, and have a good control effect on a
                variety of crops and fungal diseases. <i>B. subtilis</i> has the
                advantages of strong protein expression system, strong stress
                resistance, fast growth rate, easy colonization in plant
                rhizosphere, etc. It can exert antibacterial and antifungal
                effect through spatial and nutritional competition or produce
                anti-pathogenic substances, and can produce more than 70 kinds
                of anti-pathogenic lipids and proteins, as well as various
                volatile anti-pathogenic substances such as dimethylamine,
                formic acid, propionic acid, dimethyldisulfide and propylamine.
                <i>B. subtilis</i> is an ideal plant probiotic. Due to the
                unstable effect of biocontrol microorganisms, the main
                application methods used are combining with chemical pesticides
                or coordinating with other antagonistic microorganisms for
                controling plant fungal diseases.

              <h3>Engineered <i>B. subtilis</i></h3>
              <p>
                After BLAST, we found that the nucleic acid sequence of BvEP has
                a high homology with <i>B. subtilis</i>, and
                <i>B. subtilis</i> has a simple genetic background and a strong
                protein expression system. Therefore, we combined
                <i>B. subtilis</i> and protein immune inducing factor BvEP and
                Flg22 to modify <i>B. subtilis</i> to express the Flg22 and BvEP
                to achieve the function of 1+1>2. The engineered bacteria can be
                used in farmland during the peak period of
                <i>B. cinerea</i> outbreak, so that Tomato gray mold can be
                controlled.

                In our design, we use a strong promoter P<sub>veg</sub> to
                express our immune-inducing factor BvEP. P<sub>veg</sub> is the
                promoter of the constiutive expression target gene in
                <i>B. subtilis</i>, which contains two binding sites of the main
                σ factor a1 of <i>B. subtilis</i>, which can be simultaneously
                bound to make the gene efficient expression. At the same time,
                we select the 2x Fd Terminator to have a strong termination
                effect on the expression pathway. Finally, the pathway is
                assembled into pMA5, a commonly used protein expression vector
                of <i>B. subtilis</i> by seamless cloning, and transfer into
                <i>B. subtilis</i> WB800. During the experimental validation, we
                first verify the normal operation of this gene pathway in
                <i>E. coli</i> and ensure the effectiveness of the BvEP
                expressed by it in plants. We select pET-28a(+) as the vector of
                BvEP expression in <i>E. coli</i>, and transfer it to the
                proteinase-deficient

                with it. The outbreak of ROS is one of the characteristics of
                successfully induced plant immune response. Therefore, the

              <h3>Suicide switch</h3>
              <p>
                To prevent our engineered bacteria from flooding the field, we
                designed a <b>sucrose-induced</b> toxin-based/antitoxin system
                as a suicide switch, which includes the <i><b>mazE</b></i> and
                <i><b>mazF</b></i> genes. The <i>mazF</i> gene encodes the
                stable toxin protein MazF, which is capable of recognizing and
                cutting all ACA sequences of single-stranded mRNA, independent
                of ribosome mRNA endonuclease. Due to the high probability of
                occurrence of these three base sequences, the expression of
                <i>mazF</i> can break down almost all mRNA, thus inhibiting the
                release of ribosomes and protein synthesis on the cleaved mRNA,
                and finally leading to cells death.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The MazE antitoxin protein encoded by <i>mazE</i> is unstable.
                In the presence of sucrose, MazE is induced to be expressed and
                then degraded by the ClpPA complex (an ATP-dependent serine
                catalytic enzyme) to form a specific conformation. This
                particular conformation can recognize and bind to MazF toxin
                proteins, forming <b>hexamers</b> (FF-EE-FF) that inactivate
                them. In other words, after adding sucrose, MazE and MazF
                reached a stable state stopping cell death. But when the sucrose
                runs out, MazF regains its dominance and the cells die.

              >, pesticide abuse is a widespread problem in agriculture today
              when farmers apply pesticides. The pesticide preparations that
              farmers can buy on the market are usually in large capacity, and
              even if the optimal application amount of pesticides has been
              marked on the package or in the instruction manual, farmers will
              subjectively add excessive amounts, resulting in increased
              pesticide residues in crops, and even spread to the environment.
              In addition, due to the instability of RNAi biopesticides, RNA
              molecules are easily degraded by nucleases in the environment, so
              it is very necessary to separate RNAi biopesticides from the
              environment, so as to reduce and avoid RNA degradation.

              our biopesticide to avoid the phenomenon of pesticide abuse. In
              addition, we also try to simplify the form of products as much as
              possible, so that farmers can use them more simply and
              conveniently. Inspired by the laundry detergent capsules, we

                Every 100 cm<sup>2</sup>, 75 μm thick PVA film can be completely
                dissolved by stirring in sufficient water at room temperature
                for about 1 minute.

                - PVA film has been proved to have excellent biocompatibility
                and biodegradability, and it is the only vinyl polymer that can
                be used by bacteria as a carbon source. It can be decomposed by
                microorganisms and enzymes in nature, and it can be degraded by
                75% in 46 days, and finally it can be degraded into CO<sub

                and H<sub>2</sub>O, and it is proved to be non-toxic to life by
                biological tests.

                - Based on its water-soluble and biodegradable properties, the
                liquid formed after the PVA film is dissolved in water can
                penetrate into the soil to increase the soil agglomeration, air
                permeability and water retention, which is conducive to the
                survival of plants.

              <br />
              <li class="ps-4">
                - PVA film has high mechanical strength, good toughness and high
                tensile strength. Its tensile strength can reach 44.1 ~ 63.7MPa
                and its elongation can reach 400%.

              <li class="ps-4">
                - The barrier and anti-static properties of PVA film can help
                the contents to isolate the environment and prevent
                electrostatic dust from contaminating the product, so it can
                well avoid the degradation of RNA in contact with the nuclease
                from the environment.

              <br />
              <li class="ps-4">

              The CPP-shRNA complex we produce exists in an aqueous solution
              form. Although CPP can effectively slow down the degradation of
              RNA, it still cannot guarantee the stability of RNA molecules in
              long-term storage, so we use <b>glycerin</b> to provide a liquid
              environment in the bead. Glycerin, a polar solvent commonly used
              to preserve biological samples, can form hydrogen bonds with
              H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to reduce their activity, and can also
              form hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces with proteins and
              nucleic acids to protect biological molecules from degradation and
              deformation. Glycerin is miscible with water in any proportion,
              which ensures the fastest release of the CPP-shRNAs complex once
              the Polycobead enters the water system. In addition, although a
              small amount of the glycerin-water mixture enters the natural
              enironment, it can be degraded by the microbial community in the
              soil.

              Engineered <i>B. subtilis</i> exists in the form of concentrated
              bacterial liquid inside the PolycoBead. In order to reduce the
              interference of engineered bacteria on the CPP-shRNAs complex and
              ensure that <i>B. subtilis</i> can maintain its activity, alginate
              embedding method is used to mix engineered bacteria, calcium
              alginate embedding is one of the most widely used cell fixation
              methods, which has the advantages of high cell density, low
              toxicity to microorganisms, simple production process and high
              cell product release rate. The engineered bacteria is mixed with
              1% sodium alginate solution and then dropped into Ca<sup>2+</sup>
              solution. The sodium alginate then reacts with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to
              form a water-insoluble <b>calcium alginate shell</b> on the outer
              layer, while the engineered bacterial solution is encased in
              calcium alginate to form smaller beads. When the calcium alginate
              - engineered bacteria complex is released into the environment,
              with the loss of calcium ions, the engineered bacteria in it will
              also be released into the soil environment at a slow rate, so as
              to colonization to the tomato roots to compete for the ecological
              niche and express the immune-inducing factor BvEP, eventually
              stimulating the tomato immune mechanism and resisting the
              infection of gray mold.
