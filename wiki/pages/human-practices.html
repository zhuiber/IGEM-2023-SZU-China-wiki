                  Higreen, a major agricultural wholesale market in Shenzhen,
                  supplies over 90% of the city's fruits and vegetables. One day
                  when we were buying tomatoes in HIGREEN as usual, we
                  encountered Mr. Cheng uploading crates of tomatoes covered
                  with strange white spots. We inquired about the situation, and
                  Mr. Cheng, told us that the tomatoes was suffering gray mold
                  disease. As a result, they even affected other tomatoes that
                  were not infected during the transportation process, and led
                  to significant financial loss.

                    Mr. Cheng expressed deep concern and frustration as he
                    talked about the significant threat posed by gray mold
                    disease to his tomato planting base -- Dacheng Xin Base. He
                    highlighted that this disease posed the most severe
                    challenge. Regrettably, it had even led to devastating
                    consequences, resulting in yield reductions of up to 50%.
                    Moreover, he lamented the lack of an effective solution to
                    combat this persistent and damaging disease.

              <b>Significant Threat of Gray Mold Disease :</b>
              Based on 2020 FAO data, global tomato production reached
              approximately 189 million metric tons, with China contributing a
              significant 68 million metric tons. However, the devastating
              impact of tomato gray mold disease led to production losses
              ranging from 20% to 60%.Based on statistics from 2016, tomato gray
              mold disease annually caused more than 30 million yuan losses in
              China worth

                    After learning about the harmful result caused by gray mold
                    disease, we wanted to
                    <b>find an efficient and environmentally friendly way</b>
                    to cure the disease. So, we consulted our PI, Professor Mo
                    Beixin, who made great achievements in botanical research.
                    Upon hearing our needs and ideas, Professor Mo shared us
                    with valuable insights, suggesting that RNA interference
                    (RNAi) technology could be a potential solution. Also it has
                    many advantages:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>1.Precision:</b>
                    RNAi technology precisely targets and silences harmful
                    pathogen genes for highly focused control.
                    <br />
                    <b>2.Efficacy:</b>
                    It effectively reduces disease severity by inhibiting
                    crucial pathogen genes.
                    <br />
                    <b>3.Non-Genetic:</b>
                    RNAi avoids genetic alterations, relying on natural
                    mechanisms for temporary gene silencing.
                    <br />
                    <b>4.Safety:</b>
                    It is safe, as it doesn't introduce foreign genes or alter
                    host genomes, minimizing risks.
                    <br />
                    <b>5.Environmentally Friendly:</b>
                    RNAi naturally degrades, leaving no lasting environmental
                    residues.

                        anticipate the potential onset of plant diseases. They
                        take measures like applying pesticides in advance to
                        minimize the chances of plants being affected by
                        diseases.

                        <b>About Gray Mold Disease:</b>
                        Ms. Wang mentioned that gray mold disease is a common
                        issue in the tomato fields she manages. Additionally,
                        diseases like early blight frequently occur, causing her
                        significant distress.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Prevention and Control:</b>
                        When facing gray mold disease, Ms. Wang primarily relies
                        on chemical pesticides for control. She informed us that
                        she typically relies on her experience for early
                        prevention. For example, since gray mold disease tends
                        to occur in low-temperature and high-humidity
                        conditions, she proactively sprays pesticides under such
                        weather conditions to prevent it. This proactive
                        prevention approach is crucial because once gray mold
                        disease breaks out, it spreads rapidly. At that stage,
                        pesticide application may not effectively control it,
                        leading to significant crop reduction and economic
                        losses. Ms. Wang's emphasis on early prevention provided
                        us with valuable insights.

                        <br />
                        <b>Concerns About Chemical Pesticides:</b>
                        Ms. Wang also mentioned that most pesticides develop
                        resistance after a few applications, and she cannot use
                        the same pesticide repeatedly. She further explained
                        that some pesticides require mixing, which is
                        challenging for her as she is unsure of the correct
                        blending ratios. Additionally, some pesticides have
                        strong odors that can cause dizziness if she is exposed
                        to them for an extended period.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        control, crop rotation and chemical methods are

                        to prevent resistance.Mr. Liang shared that after
                        pesticide spraying, there's usually a waiting period
                        before harvesting. This waiting time can lead to
                        economic losses, so he values effective treatments that
                        minimize this downtime.

                        Greenhouses, insect-proof nets, and smoke control are
                        physical agricultural measures that help protect crops
                        from pests and diseases. These methods are widely used
                        in agricultural production to ensure the healthy growth
                        of crops.

                        <br />
                        <b>Pest and Disease Management:</b>
                        Mr. Hong Chuangjiang has his own philosophy, which is
                        "treat when diseased, prevent when healthy, and combine
                        Eastern and Western medicine." This philosophy
                        emphasizes the importance of timely treatment for
                        infected plants and proactive prevention of diseases.
                        Preventive measures are considered crucial because they
                        can determine whether crops will be threatened by
                        diseases in the later stages.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        During the early stages of crop growth, microbial agents
                        and fertilizers are mainly used for prevention, which
                        helps enhance the plants' immune systems. In the later
                        stages of crop growth, microbial agents are employed to
                        adjust the microbial community in the soil, maintaining
                        soil health.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Regarding the use of chemical pesticides, a restrictive
                        strategy is typically followed, limiting the number of
                        times a particular pesticide is used. This strategy aims
                        to reduce the development of pesticide resistance and
                        enhance the effectiveness of pesticides.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For plants already infected with diseases, isolation
                        methods are employed for management. However, due to the
                        large-scale cultivation, inspection work becomes
                        relatively challenging. Developing an effective
                        identification system could potentially improve the
                        efficiency of disease detection and management.

                        <b>Smart agriculture</b>
                        Smart agriculture is also widely adopted in orchards,
                        utilizing techniques such as greenhouse cultivation,
                        drip irrigation, and digital smart management.
                        Data-driven agriculture management has enabled
                        integrated water and fertilizer management,
                        significantly reducing labor costs. Integrated water and
                        fertilizer systems dissolve fertilizers in irrigation
                        water, enhancing fertilizer efficiency. Despite current
                        challenges related to data accuracy, this field still
                        holds tremendous potential for improving agricultural

                        the primary diseases affecting his tomato fields. Gray
                        mold disease is the predominant ailment in his tomato
                        fields, and they currently employ chemical pesticides

                        Mr. Cheng informed us that pesticide application usually
                        requires the assistance of knowledgeable technicians. He
                        often provides technical guidance to local farmers in
                        nearby villages. He observed that some farmers lack an
                        understanding of pesticide usage rules. Despite the
                        recommended application rates on packaging or in
                        instruction manuals, certain farmers occasionally add
                        pesticides excessively based on their subjective
                        preferences. This leads to increased pesticide residue
                        in crops and, in some cases, contamination of the
                        farmland environment. Furthermore, for pesticide
                        mixtures, farmers lack clear guidance on appropriate
                        proportions for mixing.

                        <b>Regarding gray mold disease:</b>
                        Mr. Cheng informed us that he not only sells tomatoes
                        but also has his tomato farm upstream in the industry.
                        Gray mold disease is a significant issue faced by his
                        tomato farm. It can manifest both before and after the
                        fruits set, making detection and treatment extremely
                        challenging. Currently, there are no effective methods
                        for detection or treatment. The primary approach is to
                        prevent its spread by burning infected plants.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Once gray mold disease appears after fruit setting, it
                        spreads rapidly within the crop. While greenhouse
                        cultivation can reduce the incidence of the disease, it
                        comes at a high cost and takes two years to recoup the
                        investment.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Although harvested fruits may not initially exhibit
                        symptoms, there is still a risk of fruit rot during
                        transportation due to the presence of gray mold spores.
                        This can lead to significant losses. Furthermore, gray
                        mold disease is highly contagious, exacerbating the
                        potential damage to crops.

                        biopesticides. He mentioned that his primary concern is
                        the cost. While biopesticides are environmentally
                        friendly, their higher prices can lead to an increase in
                        the overall production cost of tomatoes.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        sources from various locations based on the tomato

                        both in greenhouses and open fields. Greenhouse
                        cultivation allows for year-round harvesting and is less
                        susceptible to diseases.

                        Mr. Huang also discussed organic produce with us. He
                        explained that organic vegetables cannot be sprayed with
                        pesticides, which can sometimes result in less visually
                        appealing appearance. Organic farming relies heavily on
                        organic fertilizers, and the certification standards are
                        stringent, leading to higher production costs and
                        selling prices. However, as the economy continues to
                        develop, organic vegetables are gaining popularity due
                        to their environmentally friendly nature and superior
                        taste, and the consumer base for organic produce is
                        expanding.

                        Professor Li Yonghong informed us that agriculture in
                        Shenzhen and its surrounding areas is diverse, with a
                        focus on leafy vegetables. Various cultivation models
                        such as greenhouses and pick-your-own farms are
                        prevalent. Tomato cultivation exists in the region but
                        on a smaller scale, with a majority of pick-your-own
                        farms and small-scale farmers. Pest and disease issues,
                        including gray mold, sour rot, and powdery mildew, are
                        common, especially during the fruiting stage of
                        tomatoes. Typically, meteorological monitoring and
                        empirical predictions are used, with limited direct
                        detection methods.

                        >
                        The sale and usage of pesticides are subject to
                        government regulations, with specific qualifications
                        required for pesticide sales. Different categories of
                        pesticides with varying toxicity levels are subject to
                        different management measures. The government promotes
                        the scientific use of pesticides and provides guidance
                        to farmers on the appropriate timing and methods of
                        application. Additionally, the government is concerned
                        about the impact of pesticides on soil and takes
                        measures to reduce soil pollution. For large-scale
                        cultivation, the government entrusts specialized
                        agencies to provide agricultural pest control services
                        to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

                        Professor Li Yonghong mentioned that the advantages of
                        biopesticides lie in their environmental friendliness
                        and safety. However, they come with higher costs and
                        slower effects, requiring advance prediction and
                        forecasting. The government can establish certification
                        standards and collaborate with agricultural enterprises
                        to conduct large-scale cultivation experiments, using
                        data to prove the safety and effectiveness of
                        biopesticides, thereby gaining consumer trust.

                        <b>Significance of Promoting Biopesticides:</b>
                        The significance of promoting biopesticides lies in
                        meeting modern society's demands for environmental
                        protection and the quality of agricultural products,
                        with promising market prospects. Through government
                        guidance, promotion, the establishment of certification
                        standards, and collaboration with the market, consumers
                        are more willing to purchase agricultural products

                        Professor Li also shared her views on GMOs, stating that
                        GMO technology is part of technological advancement.
                        Public concerns about GMOs primarily result from
                        inadequate public awareness. GMO technology can be
                        beneficial for improving crop traits but must be used
                        correctly. In China, strict regulations and labeling
                        requirements are in place. Agricultural authorities
                        conduct GMO awareness campaigns. The approval timeline
                        for GMO crops varies depending on multiple stages, and
                        policy constraints exist.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <b>Tomato Production Challenges:</b>
                        The main issues in tomato production are bacterial and
                        fungal diseases, with a focus on bacterial wilt.
                        Bacterial wilt spreads rapidly in hot and humid
                        conditions and is transmitted through the soil, leading
                        to vascular blockage and wilting.Mr. Wang mentioned that
                        grafted tomatoes are primarily used to prevent
                        soil-borne diseases such as bacterial wilt and
                        Phytophthora early blight, while diseases transmitted
                        through the air, such as late blight and gray mold,
                        still require timely control through conventional
                        planting measures.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Regarding gray mold:</b>
                        Gray mold is a common disease in hot and humid
                        conditions. Tomatoes can be divided into early and late
                        crops, with late planting helping to reduce the impact
                        of gray mold. For fungal diseases like gray mold,
                        triazole-class pesticides are currently the main method
                        of control, providing effective and economical results.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Best Time for Pesticide Application:</b>
                        Mr. Wang pointed out that pesticides can be applied
                        after the disease has occurred, but based on the basic
                        principles of farming, farmers typically observe
                        seedlings daily. Once a disease is detected, they
                        immediately perform appropriate pruning and apply
                        pesticides, which generally yields good results. Leaves
                        affected by the disease, usually young leaves, need to
                        be pruned because the disease can affect photosynthesis.
                        However, it's important to note that pesticides are not
                        a universal solution, and improper use can lead to
                        reduced yields. In winter, the likelihood of disease
                        infection may increase, especially under abnormal
                        weather conditions.

                        <br />
                        <b>Regarding Disease Prediction and Warning Models:</b>
                        Currently, disease prevention is primarily based on
                        experience and meteorological factors, with early
                        preventive pesticide use being a common practice.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>About Biopesticides:</b>
                        Currently, there is a market for immunostimulants like
                        aminooligosaccharides that enhance immunity. However,
                        farmers tend to use these products less due to the lack
                        of visible effects and cost considerations. Farmers are
                        more inclined to use treatments for diseases that have
                        already occurred and focus on effectiveness.
                        Nevertheless, from a scientific development perspective,
                        there is still a pressing demand for new technologies
                        like biopesticides. Biopesticides may have some
                        limitations compared to chemical pesticides, such as the
                        environmental and storage requirements for Bacillus
                        thuringiensis. Additionally, they require specific

                        The center's responsibilities encompass various aspects
                        of agricultural production, including formulating
                        agricultural development strategies, planning, and

                        Ms. Li emphasized the strong support from the government
                        for agricultural development and new technologies. He
                        mentioned that technologies like RNAi need to go through
                        a series of processes within agricultural departments,
                        including approvals and field trials, to be implemented.
                        The government actively supports the development of new
                        technologies by providing financial aid, research
                        funding, and tax incentives, among other measures.
                        During the promotion phase, relevant departments
                        introduce and provide training to farmers to ensure the
                        correct use and widespread adoption of these new
                        technologies.

                        use of biopesticides, which align with environmental
                        conservation principles and have substantial growth
                        potential. He emphasized the importance of the
                        treatment's efficacy, as farmers are more inclined to
                        use products that deliver good results. Additionally, he
                        highlighted the convenience of product usage as a
                        crucial factor in successful promotion. Ms.Li also
                        mentioned his willingness to assist us in further
                        promotion if our technology matures.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        Technology dissemination plays a crucial role in rural
                        revitalization. Currently, many rural areas are
                        promoting the concept of "one village, one product,"
                        with the core idea being to unite farmers and support

                        <b>Regarding pesticide usage:</b>
                        the current situation is that most pesticides and
                        fertilizers are inorganic chemical products. Although
                        there are some organic fertilizer products available in
                        the market, their effectiveness is not ideal. Therefore,
                        many farmers prefer to purchase inorganic fertilizers
                        rather than choosing free organic ones. Consequently, we
                        may need to focus on improving the effectiveness of our
                        products, especially if the cost can be relatively high
                        while ensuring excellent results. Currently, the country
                        is actively promoting the development of organic and
                        biological pesticides, as well as organic fertilizers.

                        Director Chen mentioned that when our products are ready
                        for practical experimentation, we can use a
                        demonstration field approach. This allows farmers to
                        witness the product's effectiveness firsthand, and they
                        can spread the word among themselves. This is considered
                        the most effective way of promotion.

                        The teacher believes that biopesticides offer greater
                        safety. For example, while herbicides like Paraquat are
                        highly effective, they pose significant health risks to
                        humans. Consequently, liquid formulations have been
                        adjusted to have an irritating odor to prevent misuse.
                        However, these measures have not completely eliminated
                        incidents of self-harm, leading to a gradual phase-out.
                        In contrast, our biopesticides have promising prospects.
                        Unlike fertilizers and other products, our pesticides
                        still hold high value.

                        <b>Requirements for pesticide sales:</b>
                        Pesticide sales require a license and compliance with
                        various conditions and training. Purchasing pesticides
                        involves identity registration through a specialized
                        platform. Licenses typically need to be renewed every
                        five years, and past penalties may necessitate
                        reapplication. Additional requirements may include
                        maintaining records, township-level inspections, and
                        regular enforcement checks.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        Ms. Guo was randomly interviewed during our visit to the
                        Dabanqiao Market in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.
                        Dabanqiao Market is a daily market where local residents
                        purchase vegetables and fruits. It is home to more than
                        100 vendors.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Shopping Habits:</b>
                        The individual usually uses Meituan for grocery shopping
                        but decided to visit the farmer's market on this
                        occasion for its convenience and cost-effectiveness.The
                        shopper evaluates groceries based on factors like value
                        for money, pricing, and the taste of the products.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Priorities:</b>
                        There is no specific emphasis on organic or
                        pesticide-free produce during this visit. The primary
                        concern is to make practical and budget-conscious
                        purchases.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Age Differences:</b>
                        The shopper acknowledges that different age groups may
                        have varying priorities. Older individuals may place
                        more importance on pesticide residues in groceries but
                        will still consider price when making their purchases.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Inspriration:</b>
                        This also provides us with a valuable insight, which is
                        to pay special attention to the perspectives and needs
                        of different age groups when conducting consumer
                        surveys. In our future consumer surveys, we have been
                        mindful of asking about their age to observe the focus
                        areas of various age demographics.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        Ms. Lin expressed that pesticide residues and similar
                        concerns should be addressed by market regulations
                        rather than consumers. She mainly considers
                        affordability and freshness when shopping for groceries.
                        She has concerns about genetically modified crops and
                        avoids purchasing them. As for organic produce, she is
                        not very familiar with it since it's only available in a
                        few expensive supermarkets, and she doesn't actively
                        seek it out.

                        Dabanqiao Market in Nanshan District, Shenzhen. This
                        market is where local residents buy groceries and has

                        <b>Primary Purchase Considerations:</b>
                        Ms. Lin mentioned that she typically doesn't include
                        factors related to pesticide residues and similar issues
                        in her purchasing decisions, as she considers it the
                        responsibility of market regulation. When selecting food
                        items, she places greater emphasis on affordability and
                        the freshness of the ingredients. Regarding genetically
                        modified crops, she usually opts not to purchase them
                        due to concerns.

                        <b>View on Organic Food:</b>
                        Ms. Lin believes that organic food is relatively
                        expensive. She has limited knowledge about the benefits
                        of organic food and may perceive no significant
                        difference in taste and quality compared to regular
                        food. As a result, she is not very inclined to purchase

                        pesticide residue issues. He thinks it's difficult for
                        consumers to know the pesticide usage on the vegetables
                        they consume. He believes that there are many
                        genetically modified fruit tomatoes in the market(which
                        is actually a misconception on his part) and worries

                        <b>Attitude towards pesticide residues:</b>
                        Mr. Qiu believes that the issue of pesticide residues
                        requires the support of market supervision because
                        consumers often find it difficult to proactively select
                        vegetables that meet safety standards. They lack
                        relevant information and struggle to determine whether
                        the vegetables they purchase are affected by pesticide
                        residues. Therefore, he believes that promotion and the
                        establishment of relevant standards are crucial.

                        <br />
                        <b>Attitude towards GMOs:</b>
                        Holds a skeptical attitude towards genetically modified
                        organisms (GMOs) and has misconceptions, believing that
                        most tomatoes in the market are genetically modified

                        <br />
                        <b>Inspiration:</b>
                        Mr. Qiu's misconceptions have made us realize the lack
                        of knowledge and understanding among the public
                        regarding new technologies. To dispel public doubts and
                        misunderstandings about new technologies, especially
                        when it comes to emerging technologies, scientific
                        outreach becomes crucial. This underscores the need for
                        broader dissemination of relevant knowledge to ensure
                        that people have a correct understanding of new
                        technologies and are better equipped to accept and apply
                        them.

                        both grandmothers believe that market regulatory
                        authorities should ensure the safety levels of pesticide
                        residues in food. They think that consumers often find
                        it difficult to determine on their own whether
                        vegetables and fruits are affected by pesticide
                        residues, and therefore, regulatory oversight and
                        standards from relevant authorities are needed to
                        guarantee safety.

                  We employed KH9-BP100 (a CPP) combined with shRNA. By spraying
                  CPP-shRNA onto tomatoes infected with <i>B. cinerea</i>,
                  shRNA, with the assistance of CPP, can enter plant cells more
                  efficiently. This enhances the delivery efficiency of
                  biomolecules into plant cells.

                  However, by using specific sequences to link shRNAs targeting
                  different mRNAs, the resulting bi-shRNA molecules can be
                  processed into various siRNAs, each with a distinct function.
                  This approach allows for a lower effective dose compared to
                  traditional siRNA/shRNA, reducing the potential for off-target
                  effects and providing a more sustained effect.

                  Firstly, some farmers apply pesticides excessively, deviating
                  from recommended dosage, which leads to overuse and
                  environmental pollution. Secondly, farmers are often uncertain
                  about how to correctly mix and use multiple pesticides,
                  resulting in losing effectiveness.

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  To address these challenges and make pesticide application
                  more user-friendly, we drew inspiration from laundry detergent
                  beads. We decided packaging our product in a form with fixed
                  dosage , encapsulating it within a single bead. We would then
                  provide guidance to farmers on the number of beads for
                  treating and preventing tomato gray mold disease.
                  <b>These lead to the design of our product -- POLYCOBEAD.</b>

                  quantity of pesticides required when diseased plants are

                Shenzhen Agricultural Promotion Center in China, we learned that
                expanding the scale of product testing during the trial phase
                and bringing a product to market require compliance with
                relevant laws and policies. This includes ensuring the safety of
                trials, adherence to testing standards, and consideration of the
                product's safety and compliance with health and environmental
                standards. These regulations and policies are crucial for the
                commercialization of technology and industrial development.

                  our product needs to adhere to, particularly in the context of
                  emerging technologies like RNAi and novel plant immune agents.

                classification and standardized regulations for RNA pesticides.
                This highlights significant legal and regulatory challenges in
                the RNA pesticide sector in China, emphasizing the urgent need
                for applicable regulations and standards to ensure safety and

            <h3>From Unit to Union</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              After conducting legal research and standard formulation, we have
              created an orderly market environment for polycobead. Then, we
              assessed the development potential of POLYCOBEAD in a long run
              from both market and societal perspectives. We made a business
              plan and strategic formulation, proposing the "From Unit to Union"
              development plan. Starting from relevant units, we aim to connect
              each group and form a unified union—T.O.M.A.T.O Alliance.

            <p>
              <br />
              Firstly, we analyze the interests, needs, and backgrounds of each
              unit, examining the acceptance of different groups towards
              polycobead.
              <br />
              <br />
              After gaining a comprehensive understanding of each unit and the
              pesticide industry, we unite each group to form the T.O.M.A.T.O
              Alliance, including Technology-Oriented Modernization of
              Agriculture-Targeted Organization (Technical Alliance) and
              Thought-Oriented Modernization of Agriculture-Targeted
              Organization (Thought Alliance).

              <br />
              The emergence of new products is likely to pose a threat to the
              traditional chemical pesticide industry. Therefore, the
              establishment of the T.O.M.A.T.O Technology Alliance aims to avoid
              conflicts between new and old products in the market competition.
              We call for advanced biotechnology companies to join the research
              and production of biopesticides and to encourage traditional
              enterprises to undergo transformation and upgrading.

            <p>
              New products and technologies will inevitably face many cognitive
              challenges in the process of entering the market. Therefore, we
              have established the T.O.M.A.T.O Thought Alliance, uniting each
              unit, engaged in science communication and provided proposal
              suggestions. We aim to improve the awareness of all units
              involved, clearing obstacles for the promotion of products and the
              advancement of Green and Sustainable Agriculture.

                  We learned about the harm of gray mold to the agricultural
                  industry from the field inspection of the Dacheng Xin Planting
                  Base, and

                  , and made
                  <b>"5I Principle" to meet the actual needs</b>
                  . And finally generate our product ——
                  <b>POLYCOBEAD.</b>
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  At the same time, we pay attention to
                  <b
                    >the connection and impact between products and the world</b
                  >

                <br />
                <p>
                  Then, we visited the tomato base again,
                  <b

                  Through the detailed investigation of the whole process of the
                  stakeholders involved in the use of pesticides, we put forward
                  the concept --
                  <b>From Unit to Union</b>
                  . We formed
